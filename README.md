# Chat-App-React-Node

[Live Demo](https://chat.tdem.ir) - The initial visit may take up to 1 minute to load. Please be patient.

Built with React.js, Bootstrap, Node.js (Express.js), [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), and MongoDB.

A challenge I set for myself here is to develop a chat app with only two tables in the database—Users and Messages—instead of the typical three (Users, Conversations, Messages). I omitted the Conversations collection and made the chat app function without it, although I still display conversations within the app.

**Features:**

-   Authentication (Sign Up/Sign In)
-   Real-time messaging using the Socket.io framework
-   Add/Remove/Block Contacts
-   Send/Edit/Delete messages (with real-time updates) and clear message history
-   Profile editing (Full Name, Email, Username, Password, Avatar)
